# Biutiful

> Biutiful transform ES imports into browser usable ECMAScript imports.

## Getting Started

Using the command requires supplying the `input` directory which contains your source files in their original format, followed by the `output` (defaults to `./`) directory which is where all of the files and ES modules will reside.

For example, to take the files from `./src` and to write to `./public` you'd supply the following:

```bash
biutiful --input ./src --output ./public
```
